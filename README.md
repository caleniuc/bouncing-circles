Bouncing Circles 
We need an input and a button to spawn circles and start the movement 
 
Spawn n circles inside a container, of random: 
Size 
Color 
Speed 
Direction (any angle) 

The circles need to collide with the walls and bounce back with the correct angle. 
No need to handle collisions among circles.
